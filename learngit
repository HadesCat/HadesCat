learn git diff

the command "git diff" is used to compare what is in your working directory with what is in your staged area.

the command "git diff --staged" is uesd to compare what you have staged with your last commit.

it's important to note that git diff by itself doesn't show all changes made since your last commit-only changes that are still unstaged.This can be confusing.Because if you've staged all your changes,git diff will give you no output.

===========
it's the first time that i learnt git and github.These days,i have learnt how to create a new repo online or in local.
i konew some commands,such as pwd,cd,cd ..,echo content>file name,git init,ls -ah,git add,git commit (-m ""),git status,rm filename,rm -rf filename,git diff and git diff --staged,git log (--pretty=format/oneline/short/full,--graph,--abbrev-commit),git colne,git remote add origin SHH/HTTP,git push (-u) origin master,etc.

now,i create a new branch called dev ot learn how to create and manage branches,and merge them.

merge banched with no-ff not defalut mode:fast forward(ff).

learn git stash.the command is used to protect the spot when you are working.
